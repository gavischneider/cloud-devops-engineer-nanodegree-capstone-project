# cloud-devops-engineer-nanodegree-capstone-project
My Capstone Project for Udacity's Cloud DevOps Engineer Nanodegree

My project can be broken down into two parts: the application itself, and the infrastructure that deploys and hosts it.

## The application: Random Song
Random song is a simple web app built using TypeScript, Node.js and Express. It serves as a web service that can send you a random song, using the MusixMatch API. To test out the app, simply go to the '/random' route, and you'll receive a random song object in JSON.
